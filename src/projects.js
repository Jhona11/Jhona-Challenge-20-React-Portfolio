        "This application was developed to provide users with a platform for organizing their thoughts and managing tasks through note storage. It uses Express and JavaScript, employing a json file (db.json) as a pseudo-database for data storage and retrieval. My responsibilities involved creating a backend for the frontend of the application using Express, enabling users to save, retrieve, post, and delete data through the frontend UI.",
