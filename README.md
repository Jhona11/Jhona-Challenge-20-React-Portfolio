## Description

This portfolio application was developed and designed to showcase my web applications, resume, and skills to potential employers, clients, and interested parties. It was created using React an open sourced JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Material-UI, a popular component library that implements Google's Material Design. React was created by Facebook developers and helps simplify the process of building interactive and dynamic user interfaces by providing a component-based structure, efficient rendering through the virtual DOM, and a declarative syntax. It operates via a one page application, but gives the user experience of multiple page functionality.

## Live URL

https://frabjous-stardust-b8075d.netlify.app

## Installation

To make changes to the code base, clone the repo (git@github.com:Jhona11/Jhona-Challenge-20-React-Portfolio.git), run npm i within the root directory, then run npm start. You will then be taken to a live server running the site where if edits are made to the code base they can be seen in real time.

## Usage Information

This application is very user intuitive, just visit the site (https://frabjous-stardust-b8075d.netlify.app), navigate through different pages using the links in the nav-bar, and view desired content.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
